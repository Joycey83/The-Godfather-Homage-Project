# The Godfather Homage fan page

The Godfather fan page website was created for the Shecodes Responsive Add-on Project

# Introduction

A simple single page website that was created for like minded movie buffs who are also a massive fan of The Godfather Film. Fans of the film can read up on information about the director of the film, the actors and characters that they played. I also included my favourite scene videos and a photo gallery.

My approach for designing this website was to create it so that it is not only accessible to view on desktop but it is also mobile responsive. The application is also accessible through a range of different devices.
