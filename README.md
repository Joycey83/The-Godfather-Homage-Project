# The Godfather Homage fan page

The Godfather fan page website was created for the Shecodes Responsive Add-on Project

# Introduction

A simple single page website that was created for like minded movie buffs who are also a massive fan of The Godfather Film. Fans of the film can read up on information about the director of the film, the actors and characters that they played. I also included my favourite scene videos and a photo gallery.

My approach for designing this website was to create it so that it is not only accessible to view on desktop but it is also mobile responsive. The application is also accessible through a range of different devices.

# Running Locally

## Live server

1.You will need node.js and npm. You should probably install this globally.

2.run the following command in your terminal:

npm install -g live-server

3.In your project directory issue the command live-server

4.This will automatically launch the default browser. When you make a change to any file, the browser will reload the page - unless it was a CSS file in which case the changes are applied without a reload.

# Deployment

## Deploy a project to Netlify

This site was deployed to Netlify. Plese follow these steps to deploy your site:

One way to get started deploying on Netlify is to use a Deploy to Netlify button to add a site.

1.Select the Deploy to Netlify button.

You will get directed to the Netlify app to create a new site. You should find the following page, asking you to connect to GitHub.

2.Select Connect to GitHub to authenticate. If you don’t already have a Netlify user account, you will get one as part of this process.

3.Select Save & Deploy. As well as creating a new site on Netlify, this process clones the demo project repository to your GitHub account so you can make your own changes later on.

You will be redirected to the Site overview page where you can check for the deploy in the Production deploys list.
