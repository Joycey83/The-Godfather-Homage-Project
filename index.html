          <h2>The Director</h2>
          <h3>Francis Ford Coppola</h3>
          <p>
            Francis Ford Coppola born April 7, 1939 is an American film
            director, producer, and screenwriter. He is considered one of the
            major figures of the New Hollywood filmmaking movement of the 1960s
            and 1970s. Coppola is the recipient of five Academy Awards, six
            Golden Globe Awards, two Palmes d'Or, and a British Academy Film
            Award (BAFTA). After directing The Rain People in 1969, Coppola
            co-wrote Patton (1970), which earned him the Academy Award for Best
            Original Screenplay along with Edmund H. North. Coppola's reputation
            as a filmmaker was cemented with the release of The Godfather
            (1972), which revolutionized the gangster genre[6] of filmmaking,
            receiving strong commercial and critical reception. The Godfather
            won three Academy Awards: Best Picture, Best Actor, and Best Adapted
            Screenplay (shared with Mario Puzo). His film The Godfather Part II
            (1974) became the first sequel to win the Academy Award for Best
            Picture. Highly regarded by critics, the film gained Coppola three
            more Academy Awards: Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Director, and
            Best Picture, making him the second director (after Billy Wilder) to
            win these three awards for the same film.

              <h4>Character information:</h4>
              <p>
                Vito Corleone (né Andolini, April 29, 1887 / December 7, 1891 -
                July 29, 1955) was the founder and Don of the Corleone family.
                He is the son of Antonio Andolini and his wife, the brother of
                Paolo Andolini and the husband of Carmela Corleone, with whom he
                has four children: Sonny, Fredo, Michael and Connie Corleone.
              </p>
              <h4>Portrayed by:</h4>
              <h5>Marlon Brando</h5>
              <p>
                Brando became a superstar after appearing in such films as A
                Streetcar Named Desire and On the Waterfront (winning an Oscar).
                However, in the mid 1960s, he appeared in a series of flops that
                made him unhirable, until Francis Ford Coppola fought to have
                him play Don Vito Corleone in The Godfather, a role that would
                earn Brando a second Academy Award.

              <p>
                Michael Corleone was Born on March 23, 1920, to Mafia don Vito
                Corleone and his wife Carmela, Michael has two older brothers,
                Santino "Sonny" Corleone and Frederico "Fredo" Corleone, and a
                younger sister, Constanzia "Connie" Corleone.The family
                consigliere, Tom Hagen, is their informal adopted brother. Later
                Michael was the Don of the Corleone family after his father Vito
                Corleone stepped down.
              </p>
              <h4>Portrayed by:</h4>
              <h5>Al Pacino</h5>
              <p>
                Alfredo James Pacino was born on April 25, 1940 is an American
                actor. Considered one of the most influential actors of the 20th
                century, he has received numerous accolades: including an
                Academy Award, two Tony Awards, and two Primetime Emmy Awards,
                making him one of the few performers to have achieved the Triple
                Crown of Acting.
              </p>
              <p>
                His role as a heroin addict in The Panic in Needle Park (1971)
                brought Pacino to the attention of director Francis Ford
                Coppola, who cast him as Michael Corleone in what became a
                blockbuster Mafia film, The Godfather (1972) Although Jack
                Nicholson, Robert Redford, Warren Beatty, and the little-known
                Robert De Niro were tried out for the part, Coppola selected
                Pacino, to the dismay of studio executives who wanted someone
                better known.

                Vito’s consigliere Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall) having failed to
                convince studio boss Jack Woltz (John Marley) to give lousy
                actor Johnny Fontane (Al Martino) a part in a film, Woltz awakes
                to find the decapitated head of his equine pal under his

              <h4>Scene:</h4>
              <h5>The Baptism</h5>
              <p>
                In the bloody climax of the trilogy’s first film, Michael’s
                devastating descent into darkness is fully realised. Bathed in
                the golden light of a big beautiful church, the baptism of
                Connie’s baby boy is intercut with images of men getting ready,
                preparing for something – climbing the stairs; putting on a
                police uniform. As the sounds of the baby’s wails and the
                dischord of the piano organ grow to a crescendo, we realise
                something terrible is about to happen. As Michael renounces
                Satan again and again, the stone-cold ruthlessness of his orders
                are enacted, and the heads of the mob families that dared to
                cross him are dispatched with. The formerly good-hearted
                Corleone boy has not only officially taken on the ‘Godfather’
                mantle, he has become what his father always feared, in an
                unforgettable sequence that has spawned many a tribute since.

                bullets.
